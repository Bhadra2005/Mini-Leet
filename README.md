# Mini-Leet
this is a project that allows a user to complete and keep track of their progress on leetcode, it directly links the user to their leetcode profile via login. It has repetitive revision in which questions marked for revision and their links are displayed to redirect the user to that specific problem. This is implemented through redis.
